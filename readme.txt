Shooting sound effect

Art:
I created all of the assets in the game

Above and Beyond:
I added music to the game, it can be paused and turned up and down
I added a particle emmitter, which looks pretty cool
I made all of the assets in the game, other than the music
I added a highscore and previous score function, using File.IO
I added a shooting sound, but it was really annoying so I deleted it

Known Issues:
The collisions are a bit wierd on the smaller objects, but they usually work
Occasionally, an asteroid will randomly spawn in the center of the screen, not common 
but it happens
If the Highscore.txt and Prevscore.txt are not in the data folder, dying will not work
